### Aims
This module introduces Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) and Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) analytics, with a focus on time-series data from industrial systems. It covers architectures for ICPS and smart factories, industrial networking and communication (including OPC-UA), IIoT data pipelines, time-series pre-processing, classical forecasting, feature-based machine learning, deep sequential models and anomaly detection.
The emphasis is on practical data analytics in Python for industrial time-series, including case studies drawn from robotics and smart manufacturing.
