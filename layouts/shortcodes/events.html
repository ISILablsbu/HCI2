      <h3>Kilobot Swarm Intelligence</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        HCI² Lab is proud to host the 2025 Kilobot Swarm Intelligence Workshop.
        This two-day event is designed for undergraduate (BSc) and postgraduate
        (MSc) students to gain hands-on experience with decentralized,
        collective artificial intelligence. Participants will move from
        foundational principles to advanced applications, exploring how complex,
        emergent group behaviors can arise from simple, locally-executed rules.
        The forum will feature a series of technical workshops culminating in a
        dynamic swarm robotics challenge, providing a unique opportunity to
        program, test, and deploy algorithms on a large-scale Kilobot
        collective.
