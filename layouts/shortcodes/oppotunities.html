      We welcome PhD candidates interested in human-centred industrial AI, digital twins,
      human–robot collaboration, and XR-assisted (dis)assembly. Projects typically combine
      rigorous method development with evaluation on real manufacturing use-cases.
      If you are looking for a supportive, research-intensive environment with strong industrial
      and UK/EU collaboration, explore current openings and how to apply.
