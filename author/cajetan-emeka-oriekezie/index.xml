His research sits at the intersection of Applied Artificial Intelligence and environmental sustainability, specifically focusing on the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). By integrating machine learning and Explainable AI (XAI) into environmental assessment frameworks, Cajetan aims to accelerate LCA workflows while ensuring they remain transparent, robust, and accessible for practitioners. Prior to his doctoral studies, he obtained an MSc in Computer Science (specializing in Artificial Intelligence) from Nile University of Nigeria.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
