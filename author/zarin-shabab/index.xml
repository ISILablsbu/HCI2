Her research focuses on AI-driven ergonomic risk assessment, combining MediaPipe-based pose estimation, upper-limb joint-angle modelling, and automated RULA scoring to enable real-time, low-cost monitoring of human posture. She has developed and validated an intelligent ergonomic assessment framework in a real-world workstation scenario, contributing to advanced research in computer vision, human–machine interaction, and human-centred safety systems aligned with Industry 4.0/5.0.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
