          description: >
            Examines computational and statistical methods for the design of complex
            engineered systems, including design of experiments, surrogate modeling,
            surrogate-based optimization, sensitivity analysis, and mixed-variable
            design space exploration. Aerospace examples highlight advanced aircraft
            and propulsion system concepts, including methods for co-optimization of
            aircraft, propulsion, and energy/power management.

            Multidisciplinary integration of aerodynamics, performance, stability and
            control, propulsion, structures, and aeroelasticity in a system approach
            aimed at designing an aircraft to a set of specifications. Team-based
            projects are overseen and graded by faculty and may include mentoring
            from external organizations.
