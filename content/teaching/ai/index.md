            ### Aims
            
            This module introduces the fundamental concepts and techniques of Artificial Intelligence (AI) from a modern, practice-oriented perspective. It focuses on the core abstractions and algorithms used to build intelligent systems – search and optimisation, probabilistic reasoning, machine learning, neural networks and reinforcement learning – and on how these are implemented and evaluated in Python. The module also highlights opportunities, risks and responsible use of AI in real-world applications.
