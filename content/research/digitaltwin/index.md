This project introduces a human-centred Digital Twin framework that integrates multi-fidelity models, surrogate optimisation, and high-fidelity simulation to support resilient AMR fleet management in dynamic smart factories. It detects operational disruptions such as robot failures or machine breakdowns and rapidly generates incident-aware schedules while preserving throughput and energy efficiency. A human-in-the-loop decision layer allows operators to review trade-offs, request re-simulation and apply policy-bound overrides, ensuring transparency, governance and Industry 5.0–ready coordination.

{{< expand-card title="Motivation" >}}
This project addresses limitations of conventional assembly instructions that rely
on static manuals or wearable devices. By projecting guidance directly onto the
workspace, SAR reduces cognitive load and improves task flow.

{{< expand-card title="System Architecture" >}}
The system integrates computer vision, gesture recognition, and spatial projection
to deliver adaptive assembly instructions in real time.
