This project develops a human-centric Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) system that projects adaptive, light-guided assembly instructions directly onto the workspace and is controlled through AI-based hand gesture recognition. The system delivers real-time guidance and error feedback without requiring handheld or wearable devices. User studies show significant reductions in task time, error rates, and perceived workload compared to conventional instruction methods.

{{< expand-card title="Motivation" >}}
This project addresses limitations of conventional assembly instructions that rely
on static manuals or wearable devices. By projecting guidance directly onto the
workspace, SAR reduces cognitive load and improves task flow.
