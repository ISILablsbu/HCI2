abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM), particularly fused deposition modelling (FDM), facilitates the fabrication of complex geometries with increasing flexibility and efficiency. Ensuring consistent print quality in FDM processes necessitates the development of accurate defect detection mechanisms. Attention-augmented YOLO (You Only Look Once) models have emerged as a promising solution for addressing this challenge. In this study, we systematically benchmark and evaluate the performance of YOLO architectures enhanced with attention mechanisms within the context of FDM 3D printing applications. The models were trained and evaluated using representative defect datasets. The attention-augmented models demonstrate improved detection performance.
