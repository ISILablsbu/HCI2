Zarin Shabab is a Research Intern at London South Bank University, working within the Human-Centred Industrial Intelligence Lab in the School of Computer Science and Digital Technologies. Her research focuses on AI-driven ergonomic risk assessment, combining MediaPipe-based pose estimation, upper-limb joint-angle modelling, and automated RULA scoring to enable real-time, low-cost monitoring of human posture. She has developed and validated an intelligent ergonomic assessment framework in a real-world workstation scenario, contributing to advanced research in computer vision, human–machine interaction, and human-centred safety systems aligned with Industry 4.0/5.0.
