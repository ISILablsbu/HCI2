It detects operational disruptions such as robot failures or machine breakdowns and rapidly generates incident-aware schedules while preserving throughput and energy efficiency. A human-in-the-loop decision layer allows operators to review trade-offs, request re-simulation and apply policy-bound overrides, ensuring transparency, governance and Industry 5.0–ready coordination.\nMotivation As AMR fleets scale in complexity, even minor disruptions can propagate into congestion, energy inefficiency, and production delays. Existing fleet managers are largely rule-based, offering limited adaptability and minimal transparency during incidents, while optimisation-driven approaches often fail to meet real-time decision constraints. This project addresses a critical gap: how to deliver fast, adaptive scheduling decisions while keeping humans meaningfully in the loop. Rather than replacing operators, the framework augments them with prescriptive Digital Twin decision support that is policy-bound, auditable, and latency-aware, ensuring safe and accountable deployment in real manufacturing environments. System Architecture The framework adopts a layered Digital Twin architecture spanning the physical shop floor to human-centred decision support: Physical \u0026amp; Communication Layers AMRs, machines, sensors, and enterprise systems stream real-time telemetry via OPC-UA Semantically tagged events enable incident detection Data \u0026amp; Digital Shadow Layer Operational data are parsed, stored, and contextualised Maintains a real-time representation of system state Digital Layer (Multi-Fidelity DT) Low-fidelity surrogate models Seconds-level rescheduling during incidents High-fidelity simulation models Capture AMR behaviour, energy use, congestion, and safety Support validation and scenario analysis Human–Machine Interaction Layer Interactive dashboards, Pareto visualisation, Gantt charts, and override controls enable operators to review, select, and validate responses with full provenance. A rule-based allocator dynamically selects between surrogate optimisation, re-simulation, or manual override based on incident type, severity, and site policy. Key Components Incident Response Module (IRM)\nDetects and classifies disruptions from OPC-UA events and triggers appropriate response modes. Surrogate-Based Optimisation\nMulti-objective scheduling balances makespan and energy consumption under strict response-time constraints. High-Fidelity Digital Twin\nUsed for behavioural validation, what-if analysis, and post-incident performance assessment. Operator Panel (Human-in-the-Loop)\nSupports trade-off exploration via Pareto fronts, schedule inspection via Gantt charts, and audited overrides with role-based permissions. Governance \u0026amp; Provenance Layer\nAll decisions, overrides, and outcomes are logged as machine-readable artefacts, enabling traceability, accountability, and cross-shift handover. Evaluation The proposed framework is instantiated on a battery module assembly flowshop with AMR-based material handling and evaluated under representative disruption scenarios, including: AMR Breakdown\nEvaluates system resilience to autonomous mobile robot failures and material flow interruptions. Machine Breakdown\nAssesses adaptive rescheduling performance under unexpected workstation failures. Demand Change\nTests responsiveness to sudden order quantity and priority variations. Performance is assessed using the following metrics: Decision Latency (Stage-Resolved)\nMeasures the time required to generate corrective schedules at each decision stage. Makespan and Energy Deviation\nQuantifies efficiency and operational cost deviations relative to nominal schedules. Schedule Stability and Utilisation Behaviour\nEvaluates robustness by analysing task reassignment frequency and resource usage patterns. Surrogate–Simulation Agreement\nAssesses alignment between surrogate-based predictions and high-fidelity digital twin outcomes. Results Summary: Surrogate-based responses generate deployable schedules within 3–10 seconds, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in decision time compared to full high-fidelity simulation, while maintaining close behavioural alignment with the digital twin. Key Findings Real-time responsiveness with human oversight\nFast surrogate optimisation enables incident response within seconds while maintaining operator authority and decision accountability. High agreement across fidelities\nSurrogate-based decisions closely align with high-fidelity Digital Twin outcomes for both makespan and energy-related performance metrics. Improved resilience over dispatch rules\nThe Digital Twin–enabled approach consistently outperforms classical dispatching rules (FCFS, SPT, LPT) in terms of throughput stability and energy control under …","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1769428425,"objectID":"c9e3d79e3eb83f396773ecb18f034654","permalink":"https://hci2.uk/research/digitaltwin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/digitaltwin/","section":"research","summary":"Developing a human-centred, resilient Digital Twin framework that enables real-time incident-aware scheduling, operator-guided decision making, and robust Autonomous Mobile Robot fleet coordination in smart manufacturing environments.\n","tags":null,"title":"Digital Twin-Enabled Adaptive Fleet Management","type":"research"},{"authors":["Naimul Hasan","Louie Webb","Malarvizhi Kaniappan Chinnathai","Bugra Alkan"],"categories":null,"content":"This project develops a human-centric Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) system that projects adaptive, light-guided assembly instructions directly onto the workspace and is controlled through AI-based hand gesture recognition.
