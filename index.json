Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) systems provide hands-free, real-time guidance projected directly onto the workspace, and may overcome limitations of wearable or handheld AR devices, particularly in static assembly settings. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a SAR system prototype in supporting component picking and assembly tasks of varying complexity compared with traditional paper-based work instructions. We evaluated the SAR prototype against paper instructions in a within-subjects study (𝑁 = 16) using simple, medium, and hard molecular assemblies, and examined the effect of time pressure. Performancemetricswere task time, assembly errors, and picking errors; subjective workload (NASA-TLX) and user feedback were collected, and EEG frontal alpha power indexed cognitive load. Under untimed conditions, SAR reduced task time by a median 14.3% (paired Wilcoxon, 𝑊 = 573.0, 𝑝 = .0018) and lowered errors (assembly 33.0%, 𝑊 = 106.5, 𝑝 = .028; picking 30.9%, 𝑊 = 313.5, 𝑝 = .0047) versus paper. Effort and Frustration were significantly lower with SAR (𝑝 = .0006 and 𝑝 = .020), whereas Mental and Temporal Demand trended lower but were not significant (𝑝 = .066 and 𝑝 = .122). Increasing task complexity elevated workload and errors (Friedman, 𝑝 \u003c .05 on most measures). Moreover, time pressure increased mental/temporal demand and effort and reduced perceived performance (all 𝑝 \u003c .05) while SAR provided modest improvements. EEG analysis indicated a modest suppression of frontal alpha power with increasing task complexity and time pressure, consistent with higher cognitive load, while differences between instruction modalities were limited. User feedback indicated high satisfaction and a strong preference for SAR. Overall, SAR improved user experience and key performance outcomes in manual assembly, supporting its potential as an adaptive, human-centric aid for Industry 5.0 settings.","tags":["Assembly systems","Augmented reality","Industrial ergonomics","human factors","In-sity projectiion","Human-centric Manufacturing","Industry 5.0"],"title":"Spatial Augmented Reality in Manual Assembly: An Empirical Investigation of Its Effects on Assembly Performance and Cognitive Ergonomics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Louie Webb","Osman M.

The proposed multi-fidelity DT framework integrates high-fidelity simulation and surrogate optimisation models to enable real-time, incident-aware decision-making. It also introduces operator-in-the-loop interaction to support Industry 5.0’s human-centric principles, enhancing adaptability and resilience on the shop floor. This project develops an operator-centred Digital Twin framework for resilient Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) fleet management in dynamic smart manufacturing environments. Building on a multi-fidelity digital architecture that combines Digital Models, Digital Shadows, surrogate-based multi objective optimisation and high-fidelity simulation, the system detects incidents such as AMR failures, machine breakdowns and demand shocks, then generates incident aware schedules in real time. A lightweight surrogate model provides rapid rescheduling within a few seconds while remaining close to high fidelity reference behaviour, enabling throughput and energy efficiency to be preserved under disruption. In parallel, a human in the loop decision layer exposes Pareto fronts, Gantt chart previews and post simulation metrics to operators, who can select preferred trade-offs, request validation via re simulation or issue policy bound overrides, all under role-based access control. Every decision is captured as a machine-readable artefact with timestamps, reason codes and override rationale, creating a single audited trail that supports governance, cross shift handover and future learning from operator choices. The framework will be instantiated and evaluated on a battery module assembly line, providing benchmark evidence on latency, robustness and operator workload for different policy modes prioritising speed, assurance or governance, and delivering a transferable blueprint for Industry 5.0 ready, human centric AMR coordination.
